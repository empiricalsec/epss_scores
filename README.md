# EPSS Data

The current fields in the available data are:

- `cve` : The CVE identifier as specified by MITRE's CVE List
- `epss` : the EPSS score representing the probability \[0-1\] of
  exploitation in the wild in the next 30 days (following score
  publication)
- `percentile` : the percentile of the current score, the proportion of
  all scored vulnerabilities with the same or a lower EPSS score

Each of the comma-separated values (CSV) file contain the CVE Identifier, the EPSS
score and ranking percentile as of the date the data was generated. That date is in the filename.
